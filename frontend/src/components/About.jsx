                        <p>Ikigai (pronounced "ee-kee-guy") is a Japanese concept that translates to <strong>"reason for being."</strong> It represents the intersection of the things that make life fulfilling and meaningful: a unique blend of purpose, passion, and practicality.</p> 
                        <p>Rooted in Japanese culture, ikigai is about discovering the balance between what you love, what you’re good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for.
                        At its core, ikigai is a deeply personal journey that encourages individuals to reflect on their passions, strengths, and contributions to the world. It's not just about achieving happiness or success but about finding a sense of fulfillment that motivates you to wake up each morning with purpose.</p>
                        <p>The word itself comes from "iki" (life) and "gai" (value or worth), making it a way to explore the things that bring value to your life and give you a reason to live. While the idea of ikigai is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, its principles resonate universally and can serve as a powerful framework for anyone seeking clarity in their life or career.</p>

                        <p>Ikigai is often represented as a Venn diagram with four overlapping circles, each representing an essential pillar of fulfillment. The intersection of these four components is where you can find your ikigai. Let’s explore each pillar:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
